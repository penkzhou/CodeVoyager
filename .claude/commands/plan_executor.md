$ARGUMENTS is our plan file. please follow the plan file to implement, before you implement it, use a Expolre subagent to fetch enough background to get started.

one more thing: to the degree possible, use the following techniques for this implementation:

1/ use subagents as much as possible. try to keep your context window clean
2/ always do research before doing any implementation task. look for relevant existing patterns, methods and files. ask the subagent to identify where to put things
3/ use a verification agent to test every change. commit after each change. try to keep changes small
enough so they are testable
4/ keep working as long as possible. don't stop to ask me questions
